Count Repeats Specs


behavior: checks and counts two identical characters and returns 1
input: ("a", "a")
output: 1
description: this is the simplest form of comparison

behavior: checks and counts two different characters and returns 0
input: ("a", "b")
output: 0
description: this must be checked to ensure no 0 positives

behavior: checks and counts two identical words and returns 1
input: ("apple", "apple")
output: 1
description: this is similar to our first test, but requires us to run through each word checking that all characters match

behavior: checks and counts two different words and returns 1
input: ("apple", "banana")
output: 0
description: this must be checked to ensure no 0 positives

behavior: checks and counts a word against a paragraph that includes that word
input: ("apple", "an apple a day keeps the doctor away")
output: 1
description: this will tell us whether or not our word exists in the given string

behavior: counts how many times a word repeats in a given string
input: ("apple", "an apple a day keeps the doctor away")
output: 1
description: this is the same as the previous test but adds a counter to track how many times the word is used

behavior: returns 0 if the word is never used in the given string
input: ("apple", "a banana a day keeps the doctor away")
output: 0
description: this is must be checked to ensure we are only counting accurate matches

behavior: checks and counts that we are only getting whole instances of the word and not partial matches
input: ("cat", "I will walk my cat to the cathedral")
output: 1
description: this will continue to check for words, but make sure they are whole words and not partials of other words
