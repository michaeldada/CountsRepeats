input: ("a", "a")
output: true
description: this is the simplest form of comparison

behavior: checks two different characters and returns false

description: this will tell us whether or not our word exists in the given string

behavior: counts how many times a word repeats in a given string

output: 1
description: this is the same as the previous test but adds a counter to track how many times the word is used

behavior: returns 0 if the word is never used in the given string
input: ("apple", "a banana a day keeps the doctor away")
